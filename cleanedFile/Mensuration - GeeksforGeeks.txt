In simple mathematics, you can learn about mensuration. The principles of mensuration are discussed here, as are all the essential mensuration formulas.  Attention reader! All those who say programming isn't for kids, just haven't met the right mentors yet. Join the  Demo Class for First Step to Coding Course, specifically designed for students of class 8 to 12.  The students will get to learn more about the world of programming in these free classes which will definitely help them in making a wise career choice in the future. For a better understanding of these ideas, the properties of various geometric forms and the accompanying figures are also shown. Mensuration is a branch of mathematics that deals with the scale, volume, or area of various geometric forms. These forms are available in two or three dimensions. Table of Contents Mensuration of 2D shapes Mensuration of 3D shapes Mensuration of 2D shapes Mensuration is the measuring theory. It is the field of mathematics that is used to measure various figures such as the cube, cuboid, square, rectangle, cylinder, and so on. Mensuration of two-dimensional figures such as area, perimeter, and so on. The form or figure having two dimensions, such as length and breadth, is referred to as a 2-D form. A 2-D figure is something like a square, rectangle, triangle, parallelogram, trapezium, rhombus, and so on. We can measure 2-D forms using Area (A) and Perimeter (P) as discussed below: Introduction to Mensuration Area of Trapezium Area of Polygons Heron?s Formula Applications of Heron?s Formula Area of 2D Shapes Perimeter of circular figures,  Areas of sector and segment of a circle  Areas of combination of plane figures Circle Mensuration of 3D shapes Mensuration is concerned with the measuring of three-dimensional solids in terms of total surface area, lateral/curved surface area, and volume. 3D figures are those that have more than two dimensions, such as length, breadth, and height. Cube, Cuboid, Sphere, Cylinder, Cone, and other three-dimensional forms are examples. Total Surface Area, Lateral Surface Area, Curved Surface Area, and Volume are used to calculate the 3D figure are discussed in the articles below: Surface Area of Cube, Cuboid, and Cylinder Volume of Cube, Cuboid, and Cylinder Volume and Capacity Surface Area of 3D Shapes Volumes of Cubes and Cuboids Surface Areas and Volumes Volumes of a combination of solids Conversion of solids Frustum of a Cone Section of a Cone Parabola Ellipse Hyperbola Identifying Conic Sections from their Equation My Personal Notes arrow_drop_up Save Like Previous Angular 10 NgPlural Directive Next Algebra Recommended Articles Page : Mensuration - Volume of Cube, Cuboid, and Cylinder | Class 8 Maths 23, Oct 20 Introduction to Mensuration 06, Oct 20 Mensuration - Area of General Quadrilateral | Class 8 Maths 23, Oct 20 Area of Trapezium - Mensuration | Class 8 Maths 10, Nov 20 Volume and Capacity - Mensuration | Class 8 Maths 28, Dec 20 Class 8 NCERT Solutions - Chapter 11 Mensuration - Exercise 11.4 17, Nov 20 Class 8 NCERT Solutions - Chapter 11 Mensuration - Exercise 11.1 19, Nov 20 Class 8 NCERT Solutions - Chapter 11 Mensuration - Exercise 11.2 19, Nov 20 Class 8 NCERT Solutions - Chapter 11 Mensuration - Exercise 11.3 21, Nov 20 Class 8 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 21 Mensuration II (Volumes and Surface Areas of a Cuboid and a Cube) - Exercise 21.1 | Set 1 21, Nov 20 Class 8 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 21 Mensuration II (Volume and Surface Areas of a Cuboid and a Cube) - Exercise 21.1 | Set 2 21, Nov 20 Class 8 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 22 Mensuration III (Surface Area And Volume Of Right Circular Cylinder) - Exercise 22.1 | Set 1 27, Nov 20 Class 8 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 22 Mensuration III (Surface Area And Volume Of Right Circular Cylinder) - Exercise 22.1 | Set 2 27, Nov 20 Class 8 RD Sharma Solutions- Chapter 21 Mensuration II (Volumes and Surface Areas of a Cuboid and a Cube)- Exercise 21.2 | Set 1 28, Nov 20 Class 8 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 21 Mensuration II (Volumes and Surface Areas of a Cuboid and a Cube) - Exercise- 21.2 | Set 2 28, Nov 20 Class 8 RD Sharma - Chapter 21 Mensuration II (Volumes and Surface Areas of a Cuboid and a Cube) - Exercise 21.3 | Set 1 25, Dec 20 Class 8 RD Sharma - Chapter 21 Mensuration II (Volumes and Surface Areas of a Cuboid and a Cube) - Exercise 21.3 | Set 2 25, Dec 20 Class 8 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 21 Mensuration II (Volumes and Surface Areas of a Cuboid and a Cube)- Exercise 21.4 | Set 1 22, Dec 20 Class 8 RD Sharma Solutions- Chapter 22 Mensuration III (Surface Area And Volume Of Right Circular Cylinder) - Exercise 22.2 | Set 1 29, Jan 21 Class 8 RD Sharma Solutions- Chapter 22 Mensuration III (Surface Area And Volume Of Right Circular Cylinder) - Exercise 22.2 | Set 2 29, Dec 20 Article Contributed By : GeeksforGeeks Vote for difficulty Easy Normal Medium Hard Expert Article Tags : Class 10 Class 11 Class 12 Class 8 Class 9 School Learning School Mathematics Report Issue Writing code in comment?
