CV Shortlisting: There was CV shortlisting. So a strong CV is always recommended. Round 1(Online Test): VMware conducted the first round via HirePro platform. There was both audio and video proctoring. Time: Near about 107 mins. There were 4 sections. Section 1 had aptitude questions . Questions were of hard level. Section 2 had technical MCQs on Operating Systems, Computer Networks, Data Structures. These questions were also of hard level. Section 3 had one coding question of easy level implementation. Just requires basic logical thinking ability. Section 4 was optional and we have to select two languages among C, C++, Java, Python and answer respective output based questions. Note: For the first round there was sectional cut-off . So make sure you perform well in every section! only 24 students out of 150 could make it through this round successfully. Round 2(Face to Face Technical Round 1): Time: 1 hour 10 minutes It started with my introduction. Then he asked me the logic behind Merge Sort. Then he asked me to code for the following question on Code Pair . The question was slight modification of the following question on GFG: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-an-array-a-and-a-number-x-check-for-pair-in-a-with-sum-as-x/ The key thing here is that they will ask easy to medium level coding question but with some tricky corner cases. They will ask you to modify the code according to the requirements they say. The interviewer asked me one coding question but kept testing my coding skills by asking me to do required extended modification. They will notice everything like how you remove errors encountered, coding style(clean code), Logical thinking, efficient solution etc. Then he asked Computer networks questions like what is TCP, UDP, Difference between TCP and UDP, Explain all the layers of OSI model with its respective protocols, working, DHCP and Gateway difference, How will you know if your PC is using static DHCP or dynamic DHCP ?etc. Questions on Linux Commands: In Linux which command is used to change the access mode of a file? Questions on other basic Linux Commands. As I told him I am strong in Operating System , he then asked me conceptual questions on OS like he gave me a scenario of a problem and asked me which concept in OS can solve this problem and how. Mostly questions on processes, threads, synchronization, virtual memory, deadlock were asked. Brief introduction of all the projects mentioned in resume. No much cross questions were asked here. Resume based Non-technical questions. Any questions for me? 13 students out of 24 could make their way to the next round. Round 3: Round 3 depends on your performance in round 2. Like for me and few other students it was just a Manager round and for remaining it was technical + manager round. So make sure you perform excellent in each round !! Time: 30 mins It again started with my introduction. Questions about my internship I completed. He then gave me a scenario ? If I am with my team of members who are selling a ball pen to the customers then how will I design my product(ball pen) for getting maximum profit? Which test cases would I consider? Hypothetical scenario question. Two puzzles ( egg ? breaking puzzle) for linear search and Divide and Conquer method. Basic Non -tech questions He asked me if I am enrolled in any other company?s interview. 7 out of 13 students could make their way to the next round. Round 4(HR Round): Time: 15 mins. Tell me about yourself. About family background. How was the overall experience of interview. About VMware. Hobbies, interest. VMware EPCI2 principles. About my long term vision. Results: 3 students were offered FTE+ 6 month internship. I was one of them!! Hurray!! I was extremely Happy!!! Key Points To Remember: Face all the rounds confidently. Even if you don?t know the solution , give it a try. An interviewer appreciates your efforts of approaching the problem. Do not give wrong answers , if you genuinely feel you don?t know the answer accept it honestly. Try to perform excellent in every round that will give you an advantage of facing one round less. Some students faced one extra technical round as I mentioned!! All The Best!! Keep Hustling!! Thank You GfG!
