Working on an initiative to help programmers out there in such selfless manner is worth applauding. Also, It has provided platforms to many potential coders to contribute their ideas. The variety of posts ( Question specific, Q&A, Project Ideas, Quiz etc ) has enhanced its reach ability across all domains. It was GfG only which motivated me to make my first extension (GeeksQuiz). Not only for B.Tech, but M.Tech and especially for job-seekers, the site is of much help. Geek of the month -November 2015 Gaurav Ahirvar Advice to new Contributors: GeeksforGeeks has always maintained a standard of questions and is all due to collective efforts and contribution of every contributor. Believe in quality than quantity. So keep posting interesting & useful articles, your experiences and help others!! Testimonial: I was already familiar and quite good with competitive programming but the questions asked in interviews and those in competitive programming challenges are not completely similar. GeeksforGeeks provided me the perfect environment to practice a variety of algorithms and very standard interview questions, that were both challenging and interesting. When you sit for an interview, apart from programming, majority of questions are asked on C/C++/Java/OS/Networking/OOPS and several other topics.G4G has a large number of useful articles on these topics all setup in a well-structured manner that helped me to get my skills from novice to an advanced level. Overall, G4G helped preparing me and many of pals in cracking the written as well as face-to-face technical interviews and landing at very good companies. I thank and appreciate the team to provide such an awesome platform to sharpen my skills and enhance my knowledge. I would recommend this site to everyone who is planning to go for technical interviews. A word of advice to my fellow mates ? being consistent is very important and try implementing your own code before jumping to solutions (just reading the solutions and jumping on to next questions is not enough).
