It is a method of gathering and summarizing results. This has a wide range of uses, from small to large. Stats are used for any data collection, whether it is the study of the country?s population or its economy. Attention reader! All those who say programming isn't for kids, just haven't met the right mentors yet. Join the  Demo Class for First Step to Coding Course, specifically designed for students of class 8 to 12.  The students will get to learn more about the world of programming in these free classes which will definitely help them in making a wise career choice in the future. Statistics has a wide range of applications in many disciplines, including economics, psychology, geology, weather forecasts, and so on. The information gathered for research here may be quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative data can also be divided into two types: discrete and continuous. Continuous data has a spectrum rather than a single value, whereas discrete data has a fixed value. Table of Contents Statistical Data Statistical Methods Statistical Data When complete census data cannot be obtained, statisticians gather sample data through the creation of complex experiment designs and survey samples. Statistics, in and of itself, offers tools for prediction and forecasting via statistical models. The scientific discipline of probability theory includes sampling theory. In mathematical statistics, the probability is used to investigate the sampling distributions of sample statistics and, more broadly, the properties of statistical procedures like organizing and grouping data through graphs, pie charts, etc as discussed in the articles below: Data Handling Organizing Data Grouping Data Pie Chart Introduction to Graphs Linear Graphs Presentation of data Graphical representation of Data Bar graphs and Histograms Statistical Methods Any statistical method is accurate whether the structure or population under consideration meets the method?s assumptions. The fundamental distinction between classical probability theory and sampling theory is that probability theory begins with the given parameters of a total population and deduces probabilities that apply to samples. Statistical inference, on the other hand, proceeds in the other way, inferring from samples to the parameters of a greater or entire population. Let?s discuss the statistical methods as: Central Tendency Mean, Median, Mode, and Range Step deviation Method for Finding the Mean with Examples Mean, Median, and Mode of a grouped data Cumulative Frequency Curve Measures of Spread Difference Between Mean, Median, and Mode with Examples Analysis of Frequency Distribution Variance and Standard Deviation My Personal Notes arrow_drop_up Save Like Previous Copy and Paste Operation in MS Word Next Data Entry Form in Excel With Examples Recommended Articles Page : Class 10 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 7 Statistics - Exercise 7.5 | Set 2 01, Mar 21 Class 9 NCERT Solutions - Chapter 14 Statistics - Exercise 14.1 21, Nov 20 Mean, Median, Mode, and Range - Statistics | Class 9 Maths 28, Dec 20 Class 10 NCERT Solutions - Chapter 14 Statistics - Exercise 14.1 09, Dec 20 Class 10 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 7 Statistics - Exercise 7.2 17, Dec 20 Class 9 NCERT Solutions- Chapter 14 Statistics - Exercise 14.2 10, Jan 21 Class 9 NCERT Solutions- Chapter 14 Statistics - Exercise 14.4 18, Jan 21 Class 10 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 7 Statistics - Exercise 7.1 | Set 1 18, Jan 21 Class 10 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 7 Statistics - Exercise 7.1 | Set 2 18, Jan 21 Class 11 NCERT Solutions- Chapter 15 Statistics - Exercise 15.1 01, Feb 21 Class 11 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 32 Statistics - Exercise 32.5 01, Mar 21 Class 11 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 32 Statistics - Exercise 32.1 03, Feb 21 Class 11 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 32 Statistics - Exercise 32.3 03, Feb 21 Class 11 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 32 Statistics - Exercise 32.2 03, Feb 21 Class 11 RD Sharma Solutions- Chapter 32 Statistics - Exercise 32.6 16, Feb 21 Class 11 NCERT Solutions- Chapter 15 Statistics - Miscellaneous Exercise On Chapter 15 27, Feb 21 Class 9 NCERT Solutions- Chapter 14 Statistics - Exercise 14.3 18, Feb 21 Class 11 NCERT Solutions- Chapter 15 Statistics - Exercise 15.2 15, Feb 21 Class 11 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 32 Statistics - Exercise 32.4 17, Feb 21 Class 11 NCERT Solutions- Chapter 15 Statistics - Exercise 15.3 17, Feb 21 Class 11 RD Sharma Solutions - Chapter 32 Statistics - Exercise 32.7 01, Mar 21 Class 10 NCERT Solutions- Chapter 14 Statistics - Exercise 14.2 27, Feb 21 Class 10 NCERT Solutions- Chapter 14 Statistics - Exercise 14.3 27, Feb 21 Class 10 NCERT Solutions- Chapter 14 Statistics - Exercise 14.4 27, Feb 21 Article Contributed By : GeeksforGeeks Vote for difficulty Easy Normal Medium Hard Expert Article Tags : Class 10 Class 11 Class 12 Class 8 Class 9 School Learning School Mathematics Report Issue Writing code in comment?
