There are two-dimensional forms and three-dimensional shapes in Euclidean geometry. Flat shapes are two shapes in plane geometry that include triangles, squares, rectangles, and circles. 3D forms such as a square, cuboid, cone, and so on are also known as solids in solid geometry. The fundamental geometry is based on points, lines, and planes, as described in coordinate geometry. Attention reader! All those who say programming isn't for kids, just haven't met the right mentors yet. Join the  Demo Class for First Step to Coding Course, specifically designed for students of class 8 to 12.  The students will get to learn more about the world of programming in these free classes which will definitely help them in making a wise career choice in the future. The various forms of shapes in geometry help us understand the shapes we see in our daily lives. We can measure the field, circumference, and volume of shapes using geometric principles. Table of Content Plane Geometry Solid Geometry Plane Geometry Plane geometry is concerned with platforms that can be drawn on paper. Lines, circles, and triangles in two dimensions are examples. Plane geometry is another name for two-dimensional geometry. All two-dimensional figures have only two dimensions: length and width. It does not take into account the depth of the shapes. Plane figures have squares, triangles, rectangles, circles, and so on. Any of the most essential terms in plane geometry are described here in the below articles: Polygons and its types Measures of the Exterior Angles of a Polygon Rectangle, Square, Rhombus, Parallelogram Some Special Parallelograms Basic terms and definitions Pairs of Angles Parallel lines and a transversal Lines parallel to the same line and Angle Sum Property Properties of triangles Angle Sum Property of a Triangle Inequalities in a triangle Theorem ? Angle opposite to equal sides of an isosceles triangle are equal Angle sum property of a quadrilateral Types of quadrilateral Properties of Parallelograms MidPoint Theorem Kite ? Quadrilaterals Area of 2D Shapes Figures on the same base and between the same parallels Circles and its Related Terms Circle Theorems Theorem ? There is one and only one circle passing through three given non-collinear points Theorem ? The sum of opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral is 180° Basic Construction Construction of a Quadrilateral Euclid?s Definitions, Axioms, and Postulates Equivalent version of Euclid?s Fifth postulate Similar Triangles Pythagoras Theorem and it?s Converse Thales?s Theorem Criteria for Similarity of Triangles Solid Geometry Solid geometry is concerned with three-dimensional structures such as cubes, prisms, cylinders, and spheres. It is concerned with the figure?s three dimensions, which are length, width, and height. However, certain solids do not have faces (e.g. sphere). The analysis of three dimensions in Euclidean space is known as solid geometry. The structures of our environment are three-dimensional. Both three-dimensional shapes are created by rotating two-dimensional shapes. Faces, corners, and vertices are essential characteristics of 3D forms.
