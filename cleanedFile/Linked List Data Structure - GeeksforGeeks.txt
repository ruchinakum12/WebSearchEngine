The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers as shown in the below image: In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list. Topics : Singly Linked List Circular Linked List Doubly Linked List Misc Quick Links Singly Linked List : Introduction to Linked List Linked List vs Array Linked List Insertion Linked List Deletion (Deleting a given key) Linked List Deletion (Deleting a key at given position) Write a function to delete a Linked List Find Length of a Linked List (Iterative and Recursive) Search an element in a Linked List (Iterative and Recursive) Write a function to get Nth node in a Linked List Nth node from the end of a Linked List Print the middle of a given linked list Write a function that counts the number of times a given int occurs in a Linked List Detect loop in a linked list Find length of loop in linked list Function to check if a singly linked list is palindrome Remove duplicates from a sorted linked list Remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list Swap nodes in a linked list without swapping data Pairwise swap elements of a given linked list Move last element to front of a given Linked List Intersection of two Sorted Linked Lists Intersection point of two Linked Lists.

Copy a linked list with next and arbit pointer QuickSort on Doubly Linked List Swap Kth node from beginning with Kth node from end in a Linked List Merge Sort for Doubly Linked List Create a Doubly Linked List from a Ternary Tree Find pairs with given sum in doubly linked list Insert value in sorted way in a sorted doubly linked list Delete a Doubly Linked List node at a given position Count triplets in a sorted doubly linked list whose sum is equal to a given value x Remove duplicates from a sorted doubly linked list Delete all occurrences of a given key in a doubly linked list Remove duplicates from an unsorted doubly linked list Sort the biotonic doubly linked list Sort a k sorted doubly linked list Convert a given Binary Tree to Doubly Linked List | Set Program to find size of Doubly Linked List Sorted insert in a doubly linked list with head and tail pointers Large number arithmetic using doubly linked list Rotate Doubly linked list by N nodes Priority Queue using doubly linked list Reverse a doubly linked list in groups of given size Doubly Circular Linked List | Set 1 (Introduction and Insertion) Doubly Circular Linked List | Set 2 (Deletion) More >> Misc : Skip List | Set 1 (Introduction) Skip List | Set 2 (Insertion) Skip List | Set 3 (Searching and Deletion) Reverse a stack without using extra space in O(n) An interesting method to print reverse of a linked list Linked List representation of Disjoint Set Data Structures Sublist Search (Search a linked list in another list) How to insert elements in C++ STL List ? Unrolled Linked List | Set 1 (Introduction) A Programmer?s approach of looking at Array vs. Linked List How to write C functions that modify head pointer of a Linked List? Given a linked list which is sorted, how will you insert in sorted way Can we reverse a linked list in less than O(n)? Practice questions for Linked List and Recursion Construct a Maximum Sum Linked List out of two Sorted Linked Lists having some Common nodes Given only a pointer to a node to be deleted in a singly linked list, how do you delete it? Why Quick Sort preferred for Arrays and Merge Sort for Linked Lists? Squareroot(n)-th node in a Linked List Find the fractional (or n/k ? th) node in linked list Find modular node in a linked list Construct a linked list from 2D matrix Find smallest and largest elements in singly linked list Arrange consonants and vowels nodes in a linked list Partitioning a linked list around a given value and If we don?t care about making the elements of the list ?stable?
