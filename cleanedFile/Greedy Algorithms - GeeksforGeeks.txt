So the problems where choosing locally optimal also leads to global solution are best fit for Greedy. For example consider the Fractional Knapsack Problem. The local optimal strategy is to choose the item that has maximum value vs weight ratio. This strategy also leads to global optimal solution because we allowed to take fractions of an item.
