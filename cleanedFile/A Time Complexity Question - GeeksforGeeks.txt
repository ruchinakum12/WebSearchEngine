C void fun() {      int i, j;      for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)          for (j = 1; j <= log (i); j++)              printf ( "GeeksforGeeks" ); } Time Complexity of the above function can be written as ?(log 1) + ?(log 2) + ?(log 3) + . . . . + ?(log n) which is ?(log n!) Order of growth of ?log n!? and ?n log n? is same for large values of n, i.e., ?(log n!) = ?(n log n). So time complexity of fun() is ?(n log n). The expression ?(log n!) = ?(n log n) can be easily derived from following Stirling?s approximation (or Stirling?s formula).  log n! = n*log n - n = O(n*log(n))
